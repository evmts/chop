**File Path:** `/Users/williamcory/chop/ui/solid/components/evm-debugger/GasUsage.tsx`
**Last Modified:** October 25, 2024
**Lines of Code:** 117
**Component Type:** Data Visualization UI Component

---

## 1. File Overview

### Purpose
The `GasUsage` component is a specialized visualization component for the EVM debugger that displays real-time gas consumption metrics. It provides users with visual feedback about gas usage through progress bars, color-coded indicators, and educational tips about gas efficiency in Ethereum Virtual Machine operations.

### Dependencies
- **SolidJS Core:** `Component`, `createMemo`, `createSignal`, `onMount` from `solid-js`
- **UI Components:** `Code`, `Badge`, `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `Progress`, `ProgressLabel`, `ProgressValueLabel`
- **Utilities:** `cn` utility for conditional class names
- **Types:** `EvmState` interface from `~/lib/types`

### Current Implementation
The component:
- Tracks initial gas and calculates gas used/remaining
- Displays a color-coded progress bar based on gas consumption percentage
- Shows three key metrics: Initial, Used, and Remaining gas
- Provides static gas efficiency tips with context-aware badge styling
- Automatically updates `initialGas` if the state's `gasLeft` exceeds current value
- Uses responsive grid layout with proper card structure

### Key Features
1. **Dynamic gas tracking** with memoized calculations
2. **Color-coded visual feedback** (green → yellow → orange → red)
3. **Educational tips** about gas-intensive operations
4. **Reactive updates** based on EVM state changes

---

## 2. Issues Found

### Critical Severity
**None identified**

### High Severity

#### H1: Race Condition in onMount Hook
**Location:** Lines 17-21 (onMount callback)
**Issue:** The `onMount` hook updates `initialGas` based on `props.state.gasLeft`, but this logic has a critical flaw:
```typescript
onMount(() => {
    if (props.state.gasLeft > 0 && props.state.gasLeft > initialGas()) {
        setInitialGas(props.state.gasLeft)
    }
})
```

**Problems:**
1. `onMount` only runs once during component lifecycle, so subsequent state changes won't trigger this check
2. If bytecode is loaded after mount, the initial gas won't be updated
3. The condition `gasLeft > initialGas()` could lead to incorrect initial values if execution starts mid-way

**Impact:** Incorrect gas percentage calculations, misleading progress bars, and wrong gas metrics displayed to users.

**Recommendation:** Use `createEffect` instead of `onMount` to reactively track gas changes:
```typescript
createEffect(() => {
    if (props.state.gasLeft > initialGas()) {
        setInitialGas(props.state.gasLeft)
    }
})
```

#### H2: No Gas Limit Validation
**Location:** Props interface (lines 9-12) and initialGas calculation
**Issue:** The component accepts `initialGas` as an optional prop defaulting to 1,000,000, but:
- No validation if `initialGas` is zero or negative
- No handling of unrealistic gas values (e.g., 999 quadrillion)
- No connection to actual EVM gas limits (block gas limit, transaction gas limit)

**Impact:**
- Division by zero potential in `gasPercentage` calculation (line 32) - though mitigated by line 31 check
- Misleading visualizations with unrealistic gas values
- Users may not understand if gas values are realistic

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
const MAX_REASONABLE_GAS = 30_000_000 // Block gas limit
const MIN_GAS = 21000 // Minimum transaction gas

onMount(() => {
    const proposedGas = props.initialGas || 1000000
    if (proposedGas < MIN_GAS || proposedGas > MAX_REASONABLE_GAS) {
        console.warn(`Unusual gas value: ${proposedGas}`)
    }
    setInitialGas(Math.max(MIN_GAS, proposedGas))
})
```

### Medium Severity

#### M1: Negative Gas Usage Not Handled
**Location:** Lines 23-27 (gasUsed memo)
**Issue:** The calculation `init - left` assumes gas only decreases, but there's a ternary to handle negative values:
```typescript
return init > left ? init - left : 0
```

However, this masks a potential bug. If `gasLeft` exceeds `init`, it indicates:
1. Initial gas was not properly tracked
2. Gas was added during execution (impossible in real EVM)
3. State corruption

**Impact:** Silent failure of incorrect state without alerting the user or developer.

**Recommendation:** Add error handling or warning:
```typescript
const gasUsed = createMemo(() => {
    const init = initialGas()
    const left = props.state.gasLeft
    if (left > init) {
        console.error(`Gas accounting error: left (${left}) > initial (${init})`)
        return 0
    }
    return init - left
})
```

#### M2: Static Gas Efficiency Tips
**Location:** Lines 78-111 (Gas Efficiency Tips section)
**Issue:** The "tips" are hardcoded static content that:
- Doesn't relate to actual execution state
- Shows the same tips regardless of which opcodes are being executed
- Badge variants change based on arbitrary thresholds (50%, 75%, 90%) with no relation to the tip content

**Problems:**
```typescript
<Badge variant={gasPercentage() < 50 ? 'default' : 'secondary'}>1</Badge>
<span>Storage operations (SSTORE) cost 20,000 gas</span>
```
This tip appears regardless of whether SSTORE is being used.

**Impact:**
- Misleading educational content
- Missed opportunity for context-aware guidance
- Users can't learn what's actually consuming gas in their bytecode

**Recommendation:** Implement dynamic tips based on current instruction or recent operations:
```typescript
const currentInstruction = createMemo(() => {
    const blocks = props.state.blocks
    const idx = props.state.currentInstructionIndex
    // Find current opcode
    return blocks[0]?.opcodes[idx] || ''
})

const relevantTips = createMemo(() => {
    const op = currentInstruction()
    if (op === 'SSTORE' || op === 'SLOAD') return storageGasTips
    if (op.startsWith('LOG')) return eventGasTips
    // etc...
    return defaultTips
})
```

#### M3: Hard-Coded Color Thresholds
**Location:** Lines 35-41 (gasUsageColor memo)
**Issue:** Gas usage color thresholds are arbitrary magic numbers:
- `< 50%` = green
- `< 75%` = yellow
- `< 90%` = orange
- `>= 90%` = red

**Problems:**
1. No justification for these specific thresholds
2. Not configurable per use case
3. Doesn't account for different gas contexts (block limit vs transaction limit)
4. In EVM debugging, 90% gas usage might be normal and expected

**Impact:** Potentially alarmist coloring that doesn't reflect actual problems.

**Recommendation:** Make thresholds configurable:
```typescript
interface GasUsageProps {
    state: EvmState
    initialGas?: number
    thresholds?: { warning: number, danger: number, critical: number }
}

const defaultThresholds = { warning: 50, danger: 75, critical: 90 }
const thresholds = props.thresholds || defaultThresholds
```

#### M4: No Gas Refund Visualization
**Location:** Entire component (missing feature)
**Issue:** Ethereum EVM includes gas refunds for operations like `SSTORE` clearing storage and `SELFDESTRUCT`. These refunds can significantly impact final gas cost but aren't visualized.

**Impact:** Incomplete understanding of actual gas costs for users learning EVM gas mechanics.

**Recommendation:** Add a refunds section if refund data becomes available in `EvmState`.

### Low Severity

#### L1: Percentage Display Precision
**Location:** Line 58 (ProgressValueLabel)
**Issue:** Gas percentage shows one decimal place (`.toFixed(1)`) which may be:
- Too precise for high gas usage (99.9% vs 100%)
- Not precise enough for low usage (0.1% could be 0.05% or 0.14%)

**Impact:** Minor UX inconsistency.

**Recommendation:** Use conditional precision:
```typescript
{gasPercentage() < 1
    ? gasPercentage().toFixed(2)
    : gasPercentage().toFixed(1)
}%
```

#### L2: Number Formatting Locale Assumption
**Location:** Lines 49, 66, 70, 74 (toLocaleString())
**Issue:** `.toLocaleString()` uses browser's default locale, which could format numbers differently:
- US: `1,000,000`
- DE: `1.000.000`
- FR: `1 000 000`

**Impact:** Minor - locale-aware formatting is generally good, but could cause confusion if screenshots/docs show different formats.

**Recommendation:** Either document this behavior or force a specific locale:
```typescript
{initialGas().toLocaleString('en-US')}
```

#### L3: Missing Accessibility Labels
**Location:** Lines 54-61 (Progress component)
**Issue:** The progress bar lacks proper ARIA attributes for screen readers:
- No `aria-label` describing what's being measured
- No `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow`

**Impact:** Reduced accessibility for screen reader users.

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
<Progress
    value={gasPercentage()}
    fillClass={cn('bg-gradient-to-r', gasUsageColor())}
    aria-label="Gas usage percentage"
    aria-valuemin={0}
    aria-valuemax={100}
    aria-valuenow={gasPercentage()}
>
```

#### L4: Nested Card Anti-Pattern
**Location:** Lines 78-111 (Card within CardContent)
**Issue:** A `Card` component is nested inside another `Card`'s `CardContent`:
```typescript
<Card class="overflow-hidden">
    <CardHeader>...</CardHeader>
    <CardContent class="p-4">
        ...
        <Card class="mt-4 bg-muted/50">  {/* Nested card */}
```

**Impact:**
- Semantically questionable (cards within cards)
- Could cause styling conflicts
- May confuse screen readers about content hierarchy

**Recommendation:** Use a styled `<div>` or `<section>` instead:
```typescript
<section class="mt-4 rounded-lg bg-muted/50 border p-3">
    <div class="mb-2 font-medium text-xs uppercase tracking-wider">
        Gas Efficiency Tips
    </div>
    ...
</section>
```

#### L5: No Gas Cost Breakdown
**Location:** Entire component (missing feature)
**Issue:** Component shows total gas used but not:
- Gas used by instruction type (computation, memory, storage)
- Gas used per opcode
- Cumulative gas over time

**Impact:** Limited educational value for users wanting to understand gas cost sources.

**Recommendation:** Add expandable gas breakdown section with charts/tables showing gas consumption by category.

---

## 3. Incomplete Features

### IF1: Historical Gas Tracking
**Status:** Not implemented
**Description:** No way to see gas usage over time or compare gas usage across different executions.

**Use Cases:**
- Comparing two different bytecode implementations
- Identifying gas usage spikes
- Understanding gas cost patterns over execution steps

**Recommendation:**
- Add time-series chart showing gas depletion
- Store gas history in parent component state
- Visualize gas used per step/block

### IF2: Gas Cost Prediction
**Status:** Not implemented
**Description:** No estimation of gas costs for remaining operations or total execution cost.

**Use Cases:**
- Predicting if transaction will run out of gas
- Estimating total cost before execution
- Warning users about expensive upcoming operations

**Recommendation:** Analyze remaining bytecode and estimate gas costs based on opcode gas tables.

### IF3: Gas Optimization Suggestions
**Status:** Partially implemented (static tips only)
**Description:** Static tips don't provide actionable optimization advice for the specific bytecode being executed.

**Use Cases:**
- Suggesting cheaper alternative opcodes
- Identifying redundant operations
- Highlighting gas-intensive patterns

**Recommendation:** Implement pattern detection:
- Repeated SLOAD from same slot → use memory caching
- Multiple SSTORE to same slot → batch updates
- Expensive opcode usage → suggest alternatives

### IF4: Gas Limit Warning System
**Status:** Not implemented
**Description:** No warnings when approaching gas exhaustion or hitting critical thresholds.

**Use Cases:**
- Alert when >80% gas consumed
- Predict out-of-gas before it happens
- Allow users to set custom alert thresholds

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
const gasWarning = createMemo(() => {
    const pct = gasPercentage()
    if (pct > 95) return { level: 'critical', message: 'Approaching gas limit!' }
    if (pct > 80) return { level: 'warning', message: 'High gas usage' }
    return null
})
```

### IF5: Gas Comparison Mode
**Status:** Not implemented
**Description:** No way to compare gas usage between different executions or against benchmarks.

**Use Cases:**
- A/B testing contract optimizations
- Comparing against known gas-efficient patterns
- Setting gas budgets per operation

**Recommendation:** Add comparison view showing current vs previous execution side-by-side.

### IF6: Export Gas Report
**Status:** Not implemented
**Description:** No way to export or share gas usage data.

**Use Cases:**
- Creating gas audit reports
- Sharing gas metrics with team
- Documenting optimization efforts

**Recommendation:** Add export buttons for:
- JSON (raw data)
- CSV (for spreadsheet analysis)
- PNG (screenshot of visualization)

---

## 4. TODOs

**Status:** No TODO, FIXME, XXX, or HACK comments found in the codebase.

**Note:** While no explicit TODOs exist, the incomplete features and issues identified suggest several implicit todos:
1. Fix `onMount` race condition (HIGH)
2. Implement dynamic gas tips (MEDIUM)
3. Add historical gas tracking (LOW)
4. Improve accessibility (MEDIUM)

---

## 5. Code Quality Issues

### CQ1: Magic Numbers Without Constants
**Location:** Lines 15, 37-40, 84, 93, 102
**Issue:** Hard-coded numbers scattered throughout:
- `1000000` - default initial gas (line 15)
- `50`, `75`, `90` - color thresholds (lines 37-40)
- `20,000` - SSTORE gas cost (line 89)

**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Difficult to maintain, update, or understand reasoning behind values.

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
const GAS_DEFAULTS = {
    INITIAL: 1_000_000,
    THRESHOLDS: {
        WARNING: 50,
        DANGER: 75,
        CRITICAL: 90
    },
    COSTS: {
        SSTORE: 20_000,
        SLOAD: 800,
        CALL: 700
    }
} as const
```

### CQ2: Inconsistent Units Display
**Location:** Lines 49, 66, 70, 74
**Issue:** Gas values displayed without units or context:
```typescript
<Code class="font-semibold">{initialGas().toLocaleString()}</Code>
```

**Problems:**
- No "gas" label
- Could be confused with other metrics
- No conversion to other units (gwei, ETH)

**Impact:** Users unfamiliar with EVM may not understand these are gas units.

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
<Code class="font-semibold">{initialGas().toLocaleString()} gas</Code>
```

### CQ3: Component Size and Complexity
**Location:** Entire component (117 lines)
**Issue:** Component handles:
- State management (initialGas)
- Complex calculations (memos)
- Extensive UI rendering
- Educational content

**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Could be split for better maintainability.

**Recommendation:** Consider extracting:
- `GasMetrics` component (calculations)
- `GasProgressBar` component (progress visualization)
- `GasTips` component (educational content)

### CQ4: Tightly Coupled to EvmState
**Location:** Props interface (lines 9-12)
**Issue:** Component requires full `EvmState` object but only uses `gasLeft`:
```typescript
interface GasUsageProps {
    state: EvmState  // Only uses state.gasLeft
    initialGas?: number
}
```

**Impact:**
- Unnecessary coupling
- Re-renders on any state change, not just gas changes
- Difficult to test in isolation

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
interface GasUsageProps {
    gasLeft: number  // Extract what's actually needed
    initialGas?: number
    currentInstruction?: string  // For dynamic tips
}
```

### CQ5: Gradient Class Construction
**Location:** Line 55
**Issue:** Using `cn()` utility to conditionally construct gradient classes:
```typescript
fillClass={cn('bg-gradient-to-r', gasUsageColor())}
```

**Problem:** The `gasUsageColor()` memo returns Tailwind classes like `'from-green-500 to-green-600'`, which are then concatenated. This works but is fragile if Tailwind purging isn't configured correctly.

**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Classes might be purged in production builds.

**Recommendation:** Ensure all gradient combinations are in safelist, or use inline styles for dynamic colors.

### CQ6: No JSDoc Comments
**Location:** Entire file
**Issue:** No documentation comments for:
- Component purpose
- Props interface
- Complex memos
- Educational content source

**Impact:** Poor IDE intellisense, unclear intent for other developers.

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
/**
 * Displays real-time gas consumption metrics for EVM execution
 *
 * Shows:
 * - Color-coded progress bar (green → yellow → orange → red)
 * - Initial, used, and remaining gas
 * - Educational tips about gas-intensive operations
 *
 * @param state - Current EVM state containing gasLeft
 * @param initialGas - Starting gas amount (defaults to 1M)
 *
 * @example
 * <GasUsage
 *   state={evmState}
 *   initialGas={10000000}
 * />
 */
```

### CQ7: Redundant Code in Badge Generation
**Location:** Lines 82-108
**Issue:** Three nearly identical badge/tip structures with only the number, condition, and text different:
```typescript
<div class="flex items-start gap-2">
    <Badge variant={gasPercentage() < 50 ? 'default' : 'secondary'} ...>
        1
    </Badge>
    <span>Storage operations (SSTORE) cost 20,000 gas</span>
</div>
```

**Impact:** Code duplication, harder to maintain.

**Recommendation:** Extract to data structure:
```typescript
const gasTips = [
    { threshold: 50, text: 'Storage operations (SSTORE) cost 20,000 gas' },
    { threshold: 75, text: 'Memory expansion costs increase quadratically' },
    { threshold: 90, text: 'External calls can consume significant gas' }
]

<For each={gasTips}>
    {(tip, idx) => (
        <div class="flex items-start gap-2">
            <Badge variant={gasPercentage() < tip.threshold ? 'default' : 'secondary'}>
                {idx() + 1}
            </Badge>
            <span>{tip.text}</span>
        </div>
    )}
</For>
```

### CQ8: Memoization Overkill
**Location:** Lines 23-41
**Issue:** Three separate memos that could be combined:
```typescript
const gasUsed = createMemo(...)
const gasPercentage = createMemo(...)
const gasUsageColor = createMemo(...)
```

**Analysis:** While memoization is good practice, having three memos that all depend on the same inputs adds minimal performance benefit but increases code complexity.

**Severity:** Very Low
**Impact:** Negligible - this is actually fine for code clarity.

**Note:** This is NOT an issue. Keeping these separate improves readability and follows good SolidJS patterns. Only mentioned for completeness.

## 6. Missing Test Coverage

### Test Status: ZERO COVERAGE

**Findings:**
- No test files found: `GasUsage.test.tsx`, `GasUsage.spec.tsx`, or similar
- No test directory found in `/Users/williamcory/chop/ui/solid/components/evm-debugger/`
- Package.json not found in UI directory (likely in parent)
- The entire UI application appears to have no test infrastructure

### Required Test Coverage

#### Unit Tests Needed:

1. **Initialization Tests**

   - Should not update initialGas if gasLeft is lower

2. **Gas Calculation Tests**
   - Should calculate gasUsed correctly (init - left)
   - Should return 0 for gasUsed when gasLeft > initialGas
   - Should calculate gasPercentage correctly
   - Should return 0% when initialGas is 0 (edge case)

3. **Color Coding Tests**

   - Tip 2 badge should be 'default' when usage < 75%, 'secondary' otherwise
   - Tip 3 badge should be 'default' when usage < 90%, 'secondary' otherwise

7. **Reactivity Tests**
   - Should update gasUsed when state.gasLeft changes
   - Should update percentage when gas values change
   - Should update color when percentage crosses thresholds
   - Should re-render when props.state updates

8. **Edge Cases**
   - Should handle gasLeft = 0 (full consumption)
   - Should handle gasLeft = initialGas (no consumption)
   - Should handle gasLeft > initialGas (accounting error)
   - Should handle very large gas numbers (> 1 billion)
   - Should handle very small gas numbers (< 1000)

9. **UI Component Integration Tests**
   - Should properly pass props to Progress component
   - Should properly pass props to Card components
   - Should properly pass props to Badge components
   - Should properly apply gradient classes

#### Integration Tests Needed:

1. **With EvmDebugger Parent**
   - Should receive EvmState updates from parent
   - Should display correct gas as EVM executes
   - Should update in real-time during step execution

2. **With EVM Execution**
   - Should reflect gas consumption of different opcodes
   - Should show decreasing gas as steps execute
   - Should handle execution completion (gasLeft = 0 or near 0)

#### Visual Regression Tests:

1. **Snapshot Tests**
   - Snapshot at 0% usage (green)
   - Snapshot at 50% usage (yellow)
   - Snapshot at 75% usage (orange)
   - Snapshot at 90% usage (red)

   - Mobile layout (<768px)

#### Accessibility Tests:

1. **Screen Reader Tests**
   - Progress bar should be announced correctly
   - Gas values should be readable
   - Tips should be navigable

2. **Keyboard Navigation Tests**
   - All interactive elements should be keyboard accessible
   - Focus indicators should be visible

3. **Color Contrast Tests**
   - All color combinations should meet WCAG AA standards
   - Text should be readable in both light and dark modes

### Testing Setup Recommendations

**Required Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@solidjs/testing-library": "^0.8.x",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.x",
    "vitest": "^2.x",
    "jsdom": "^24.x",
    "@vitest/ui": "^2.x",
    "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^2.x"
  }
}
```

**Configuration Files:**
- `vitest.config.ts` for test runner
- `setupTests.ts` for global config
- Mock EVM state fixtures in `__fixtures__/evmStates.ts`

**Sample Test Structure:**
```typescript
// GasUsage.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@solidjs/testing-library'
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import GasUsage from './GasUsage'

describe('GasUsage', () => {
    const mockState = { gasLeft: 500000, /* ... */ }

    it('should display correct gas percentage', () => {
        render(() => <GasUsage state={mockState} initialGas={1000000} />)
        expect(screen.getByText('50.0%')).toBeInTheDocument()
    })

    // ... more tests
})
```

### Estimated Test Coverage Gap: 100%

The component has ZERO automated test coverage. Given its role in displaying critical gas metrics for EVM debugging, this is a significant risk.

**Priority Level:** HIGH - Gas calculations are critical for understanding EVM execution costs.

## Summary

### Overall Assessment: FUNCTIONAL WITH SIGNIFICANT ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

**Strengths:**
- Clean, readable code structure following SolidJS best practices
- Good use of memoization for performance
- Visually appealing UI with color-coded feedback
- Educational content (though static)
- Responsive layout with proper component composition
- Proper TypeScript typing

**Critical Gaps:**
- **ZERO test coverage** for critical gas calculations
- **Race condition in onMount** leading to incorrect gas tracking
- **No validation** of gas values or accounting errors
- **Static educational content** that doesn't reflect actual execution
- **No historical tracking** or comparison features
- **Tightly coupled** to full EvmState object

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Production Readiness:** 65/100
- **Calculation Accuracy:** 70/100 (race condition risk)
- **Maintainability:** 75/100
- **Test Coverage:** 0/100
- **User Experience:** 70/100
- **Accessibility:** 60/100

### Severity Distribution
- **Critical:** 0 issues
- **High:** 2 issues (race condition, no validation)
- **Medium:** 4 issues (negative gas, static tips, hard-coded colors, no refunds)
- **Low:** 5 issues (precision, locale, a11y, nested card, no breakdown)

### Verdict

The `GasUsage` component is **functionally adequate** for basic gas visualization but has several issues that compromise its reliability and educational value. The most critical issue is the **race condition in `onMount`** that can lead to incorrect gas tracking, combined with the complete absence of tests to catch such bugs.

The component successfully displays gas metrics and provides visual feedback, but falls short of its potential as an educational tool due to static, non-contextual tips. The lack of historical tracking, gas breakdown, and prediction features limits its usefulness for serious EVM debugging and optimization work.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Fix the `onMount` race condition (CRITICAL)
2. Add comprehensive test coverage (CRITICAL)
3. Add gas accounting validation (HIGH)

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Implement dynamic, context-aware gas tips (HIGH)
2. Improve accessibility (HIGH)
3. Add historical tracking and comparison features (MEDIUM)
4. Implement gas cost breakdown and predictions (MEDIUM)

### Code Metrics
- **Total Lines:** 117
- **Logic:** ~25 lines (memos, calculations)
- **JSX/Markup:** ~80 lines
- **Type Definitions:** ~4 lines
- **Educational Content:** ~30 lines (26% of component)
- **Complexity:** Medium (3 memos, 1 effect, conditional rendering)

The high percentage of educational content (tips) suggests this could be extracted to a separate component or configuration file for better maintainability.

## Appendix A: Gas Cost Reference

For context, here are common EVM gas costs (as of recent Ethereum):

| Operation | Gas Cost | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| ADD, SUB, MUL | 3 | Arithmetic |
| DIV, MOD | 5 | Division |
| SLOAD | 2,100 | Storage read (cold) |
| SSTORE | 20,000 | Storage write (new) |
| SSTORE | 5,000 | Storage update |
| CALL | 700+ | External call base |
| CREATE | 32,000 | Contract creation |
| LOG0 | 375 | Event emission |
| SHA3/KECCAK256 | 30 + 6/word | Hashing |
| JUMPDEST | 1 | Jump destination |
| RETURN | 0 | Return |

The component's tip about SSTORE costing 20,000 gas is accurate but incomplete (doesn't mention updates cost less).

## Appendix B: Suggested Improvements Priority Matrix

| Priority | Effort | Impact | Task |
|----------|--------|--------|------|
| P0 | Low | High | Fix onMount race condition |
| P0 | Medium | High | Add test coverage |
